# Introduction
[**3DQD: Generalized Deep 3D Shape Prior via Part-Discretized Diffusion Process**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10406)<br>

**[abstract]** *3DQD is a generalized 3D shape generation prior model, tailored for multiple 3D tasks including unconditional shape generation, point cloud completion, and crossmodality shape generation, etc. 3DQD first learns a compact representation with P-VQ-VAE for its advantages in computational saving and consistency among
different tasks. Then a novel discrete diffusion generator is trained with accurate, expressive and diversified object structural modeling. Multi-frequency fusion modules are developed to suppress high-frequency outliers.*

```


# Pretrained Models
Pre-trained models are available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_CUhSU7sAmMWoHwzkJO0yeRjAJ5KhNNr?usp=sharing).  
The download the pre-trained models from the provided links should be put into the `./saved_ckpt` folder.

# Preparing the Data
[[`One Drive`](https://1drv.ms/u/s!ApvxZzWKg6qdhAa16a5AqsPjQen4?e=0pr3fs6)]
We follow the instructions from [AutoSDF](https://github.com/yccyenchicheng/AutoSDF) to preprocess data.

1. [ShapeNet](https://www.shapenet.org)

First you need to download the `ShapeNetCore.v1` following the instruction of `https://www.shapenet.org/account/`. 

To extract SDF values, we followed the [preprocessing steps from DISN](https://github.com/laughtervv/DISN).

The preprocessed data can be downloaded from [One Drive](https://1drv.ms/u/s!ApvxZzWKg6qdhAaJBq1qFa1sIqYV?e=8spCDn)

2. [ShapeGlot](https://github.com/optas/shapeglot)  

```
cd {dataroot}   # Here is your own Dataroot
git clone https://github.com/optas/shapeglot

# Follow the instructions from ShapeGlot to download the shape-text pairs data.
# You need first finish a questionnaire in https://github.com/optas/shapeglot. 
# Then you will receive a link and put it into the file 'download_data.sh'.

cd shapeglot/
./download_data.sh
```

3. (Optional for single-view reconstruciton)[Pix3D](https://github.com/xingyuansun/pix3d)

We preprocess the Pix3D datasets similarly to ShapeNet.

The preprocessed data can be downloaded from [One Drive](https://1drv.ms/u/c/9daa838a3567f19b/EX579npQYYtIiQNvWdu7zbcBP2tTbW2Xk3SOk9MKxTPNAg?e=i10UvZ).

# Evaluating
We offer three kinds of scripts to evaluate the trained model. Every script will produce a logger `log.txt` to record your hyperparameter settings and metrics during evaluating.

```
# To evaluating models for unconditional generation.
python evaluation_scripts/eval_uncond.py --cat {car|airplane|chair} --ckpt {MODEL_PATH}

# To evaluating models for shape completion.
python evaluation_scripts/eval_shape_comp.py --ckpt {MODEL_PATH} --comp_type {half|octant}

# To evaluating models for text-driven generation.
python evaluation_scripts/eval_textdf.py --ckpt {MODEL_PATH}
```


# Training
The whole training has two stages, which means the **P-VQ-VAE** and **discrete diffusion generator** are trained **seperately**.

1. First train the `P-VQ-VAE` on `ShapeNet`:
```
./launchers/train_pvqvae_snet.sh
```

After training, copy the trained `P-VQ-VAE` checkpoint (`pretrained-vqvae-snet.ckpt`) to the `./saved_ckpt folder`. Based on this quantized feature representation of shape, diffusion models on various tasks can be trained.

2. Then extract the code for each sample of ShapeNet (caching them for training the diffusion):
```
./launchers/extract_pvqvae_snet.sh
```

3. Train the diffusion models for various tasks:
```
 # Tarin the discrete diffusion generator on 13 categories in Shapenet for shape completion.
./launchers/train_comp_df_snet_code.sh  

# Tarin the discrete diffusion generator on single(car|chair|airplane) category for unconditional generation.
./launchers/train_uncond_df_snet_code.sh

# Tarin the discrete diffusion generator on chair category for text-driven generation.
./launchers/train_textdf_shapeglot.sh
```
